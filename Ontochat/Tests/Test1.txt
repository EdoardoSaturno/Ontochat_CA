Edoardo is one of the greatest warlords to ever walk the Badlands. He wants to organize an arena event called "BloodBath," where the strongest orcs of the Badlands will test their skills against one another. Each fighter is either a "Black Orc" or an "Orc Boyz" and each carries a specific weapon. The weapon types include "Great Axe," "Choppa," or "Big Rusted Sword". Additionally, some fighters may randomly take on the role of a "Black Orc Big Boss" if they are Black Orcs or an "Orc Big Boss" if they are Orc Boyz. An Orc Big Boss of any type is bigger and stronger than a regular orc and is able to kill opponents in one hit.
