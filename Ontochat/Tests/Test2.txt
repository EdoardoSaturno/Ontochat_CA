The Piston Cup is an event organized by Riccardo that takes place every year in Oregon, starting from 2016. Two types of motorcycles participate in the competition: the white motorcycle and the red motorcycle. The white motorcycle has a very high top speed but has a low acceleration, while the red motorcycle has excellent acceleration but a low top speed. Each year, the track has a different shape; sometimes there are many curves, while other times it is entirely straight. It is boss Riccardo Marvasi who decides what shape the track will have from year to year. Another interesting aspect of the Piston Cup is that sometimes it rains heavily. When it rains, the red motorcycle is greatly advantaged, while when it is very hot and there is no rain, the white motorcycle has the advantage.
