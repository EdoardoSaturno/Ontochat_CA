        Hello! I am OntoChat, your conversational ontology engineering assistant, to help you generate 
        user stories, elicit requirements, and extract and analyze competency questions. In ontology engineering, 
        a user story contains all the requirements from the perspective of an end user of the ontology. It is a way 
        of capturing what a user needs to achieve with the ontology while also providing context and value. This demo 
        will guide you step-by-step to create a user story and generate competency questions from it. Once you are 
        ready, start inputting your persona, objective (goal), and sample data and chat with the chatbot. Once you 
        find the generated user story satisfactory, please copy the generated user story and go to the next step (
